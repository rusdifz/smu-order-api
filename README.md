# Wings Online Order API Service

This repository is an [API Service](https://gitlab.com/groups/nri-in/clients/smu/wo/backend/-/wikis/api-service) component that provides endpoints related to the `order` domain or context.

## Prerequisites

### Ensure `nvm` is installed

Make sure you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) installed on your machine. `nvm` allows you to easily install and switch between different versions of Node.js via the command line.

### Install the Required Node.JS Version

Run the following command to install the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file:

```
nvm install
```

This will automatically read the version from the .nvmrc file and install it.

### Ensure `yarn` is installed

This project uses **Yarn Classic v1.22.22**. You can find more details on it [here](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). Ensure you have this version installed, and it's generally recommended to install `yarn` globally. You can install it by running:

```
npm i -g yarn
```

### Obtain credentials to install `@wings-corporation/*` package(s)

This repository depends on the JavaScript library (`@wings-corporation`), which is deployed to the GitLab package registry. To authenticate with the registry, youâ€™ll need appropriate credentials. For more information on the available credentials and how to authenticate, please refer to the [GitLab authentication documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/packages/npm_registry/#authenticate-to-the-package-registry).

Once you've obtain the appropriate credentials (usually in a form of token), create a `.npmrc` file in the root directory of this project. Include the following lines in the `.npmrc` file:

```
@wings-corporation:registry=<domain_name>/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/npm/
//<domain_name>/api/v4/projects/<project_id>/packages/npm/:_authToken=<token>
//<domain_name>/api/v4/packages/npm/:_authToken=<token>
```

Replace `<domain_name>` with your domain name. For example, `gitlab.com` and `<project_id>` with the project ID from the project overview page.

## Getting started

### Starting app

To start the app on your machine:

1. Prepare environment variable by refering to `Application Configuration` on section `Configurations`
2. Install dependency by running

```bash
# install dependency
$ yarn
```

3. To start, run the script:

```bash
# start the app
$ yarn start

# start the app in watch mode
$ yarn start:dev
```

### Build the app

The app build as Docker image. We provide `Dockerfile` and `Bash Script` to build the app. The script aims to builds and pushes a Docker image to a Docker registry.

1.  Prepare environment variable by refering to `Docker build environment` on section `Configurations`
2.  Run the script:

```bash
# Build app as docker image
$ ./ci/bin/build
```
